## Congratulations

You completed all the action challenges, including Stripe!

**In real life**: Many apps collect credit card information during the sign-up and login process to confirm the user intent to buy. This is a common use-case in streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ and in SaaS services with a individual plan, and in apps with reverse trial pricing.
